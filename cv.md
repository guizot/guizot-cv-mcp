## Personal Journey

### 1994: Born in the Calm Before the Code
In late 1994, I was born in Cirebon, a peaceful coastal city in West Java, Indonesia, where tradition and simplicity defined daily life. Raised in a Chinese-Indonesian household, I grew up surrounded by the warmth of family, the discipline of heritage, and the quiet encouragement to be curious. Before I knew what programming was, I was already taking apart gadgets to see how they worked.

### 2000 - 2013: Shaped by Books, Values, and Early Curiosity
My formative years were spent at Santa Maria Cirebon, a school that helped lay the foundation for my academic and personal journey. I gravitated towards math and science—fields that taught me to analyze, think logically, and solve problems. These were the years I first interacted with computers—not just as tools for play, but as portals for creativity and invention.

### 2013 - 2017: The City, the Code, and the Birth of a Dream
I moved to Jakarta to attend Binus University. I majored in Computer Science, specializing in Mobile Application and Technology. During these years, I spent countless hours learning how to build apps from the ground up, experimenting with new tools, and slowly discovering what kind of developer I wanted to become. In 2017, I graduated with the degree Sarjana Komputer—carrying not just a certificate, but a growing sense of purpose and a deep excitement for what lay ahead.

### 2017 - Today: From Developer to Builder of Digital Experiences
After graduation, I began my professional journey as a Mobile Developer in several companies across Jakarta and Tangerang, working on meaningful projects across healthcare, finance, public services, and digital identity. I became fluent in Flutter, Android (Jetpack Compose), React Native, and embraced principles like Clean Architecture, UI/UX design, and secure development practices. From creating apps that support face recognition and digital signatures to building tools that connect patients with doctors, I've seen first-hand how powerful mobile technology can be in solving real-world problems.

### Today & Beyond: The Road to a Bigger Dream
Even after years in the industry, I still consider myself a student of the craft. I continue to build personal projects, explore new frameworks, design interfaces, and challenge myself to go further than yesterday. What drives me isn't just new tech—it's the desire to build things that matter, to craft software that feels good to use, and to solve real human problems through thoughtful design and robust code.
